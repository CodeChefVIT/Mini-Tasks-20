# Frontend Task

I made a website for Top Rahmen that can:

1) Utilize response parameters: [Brand, Variety, Style, Country, Stars, Top Ten].
2) Implement a functionality of list top restaurants of different years on the UI. Provide a search box using which users can call for restaurant details.
3) Visually interactive responsive design listing all the details.
4) Create a Sorting Option using Name, Country, Stars.
5) Depict all the other response parameters on the UI for each restaurant beautifully.
6) A feature to list a restaurant based on the country.
7) Use of JSON data to fetch top ramen restaurant details.

The link to the JSON file is: <https://bit.ly/test-json>.
